=head1 NAME

Coro::Countdown - a counter that signals when it reaches 0

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Coro;
  use Coro::Countdown;

  my $counter = Coro::Countdown->new;
  $counter->up;
  
  async { $counter->down };

  # Block until $counter->down is called
  $counter->join;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Oftentimes it is necessary to wait until all users of a resource have completed
before a program may continue. Examples of this include a pool of pending
network requests, etc. A countdown signal will broadcast to any waiters once
all "checked out" resources have been "returned".

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Optionally takes an initial value, defaulting to 0.

=head2 join

Cedes until the count decrements to 0. If the counter is already at 0, returns
immediately.

=head2 count

Returns the current counter value.

=head2 up

Increments the counter value ("checks out" a resource).

=head2 down

Decrements the counter value ("returns" the resource). If the counter reaches
0, all watchers are signaled and the counter resets. It is then ready to be
reused.
